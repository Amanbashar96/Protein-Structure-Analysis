# Protein-Structure-Analysis
The P1 and P40/P90 proteins of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were targeted for inhibiting
its pathogenic activity and comparative analysis.
potential binding sites on P1 and P40/P90 that could be targeted for
inhibition were found.
the potential challenges and limitations of targeting P1 and P40/P90
proteins for Mycoplasma pneumoniae treatment were discussed.
the significance of this research in developing novel therapeutic strategies
for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections were also discussed.
